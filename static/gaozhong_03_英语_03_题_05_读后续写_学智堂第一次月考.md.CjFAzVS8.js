I rolled up my trousers and saw blood. The leggings had acted as a bit of a barrier but there were fang marks on the left side of my knee, seeping blood. I managed to stop the bleeding and cleaned up as best as I could with tissues from my bag. I couldn’t walk up the volcano, but I couldn’t go back down either because I’d have to pass them again. I imagined being stuck by myself all night. I was really scared. Suddenly I heard rustling and froze.</em></p><p><em>A pickup truck appeared, driven by the ranger. I must have been as white as a sheet. He told me to get in. The relief was unbelievable. A few minutes later, we saw the dogs in the road where I’d left them. As we drove past, they jumped up at the truck, growling. When we finally reached the gate, I saw the American couple. I learned it was they who told the ranger what had happened. I could never thank them enough for what they did for me. They saved my life!</em></p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title custom-block-title-default">TIP</p><p>【文章大意】本文讲述了作者在 2018 年圣诞节期间去攀登巴鲁火山，她喜欢独自旅行，起初护林员不同意她独自前往，但看到她身后有一对美国夫妇，才勉强同意。起初攀登很顺利，但她突然遇到两只狗，它们向她冲过来并用牙齿咬了她的腿，疼痛让她喘不过气来，但她没有反击，而是颤抖着身体试着往前走，最后远离了狗的视线。</p><p>1.段落续写：</p><p>①由第一段首句内容“当我认为安全的时候，我停了下来。”可知，第一段可描写作者的伤势和作者的心理活动。</p><p>②由第二段首句内容“一辆小货车出现了，由护林员驾驶。”可知，第二段可描写护林员为什么会出现及作者是否脱险。</p><p>2.续写线索：伤势严重——处理伤口——我的心理活动——护林员出现——我得救了——护林员为什么会出现——我的感受</p><p>3.词汇激活</p><p>行为类</p><p>①.渗出：seep/ooze</p><p>②.到达：reach/get to</p><p>③.得知：learn/be informed of</p><p>情绪类</p><p>①.害怕的：scared/afraid</p><p>②.难以置信的：unbelievable/incredible</p></div>`,6)])}var u=o(c,[[`render`,l]]);export{s as __pageData,u as default};

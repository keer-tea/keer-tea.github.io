Gradually, he found writing poems the most appropriate way to convey his joy and sorrow. When his poem Contradictory Blank won him a national championship and a scholarship to the Moscow University from a sponsor, he was just an unknown librarian. After getting his diploma, he devoted his life to writing poems. Using concrete but flexible language and the minimum of words is his style. He tried out different patterns and preferred nursery rhyme in particular. The following is a translation of one of his works made up of 3 sections:</p><p>Little sparrow with heavy load, Ran out of energy and very cold; No compass and all sweat salty, Can you go through the endless darkness? Little balloon let out by the thread, Flew over cottages and was very glad; With warmth transformed from sunlight, He said he could forever fly; Take it easy, little balloon; Don’t tease the sparrow with his wound; On the bare branch and have a rest; This diamond heart will eventually get success.</p></details><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title custom-block-title-default">TIP</p></div>`,8)])}var f=c(u,[[`render`,d]]);export{l as __pageData,f as default};
